The jquery.Formbuilder plugin is a jQuery plugin that allows you add
a form-creation, display, and basic validation tool into your application.

The API and example code has been left open for you to override, assuming that
you want complete control over how the form data is saved and loaded. However
we have provided some basic database loading/saving examples using PDO for MySQL.

Please report all issues, bugs, and feature suggestions
to: https://snowy-evening.com/botsko/jquery-form-builder/

The tool interface is constructed using form data presented in JSON format
by the server. The php class assists you with storing the data,
generating the json, generating the html form, and processing the data.

A demo of this version may be found at http://botsko.net/Demos/formbuilder/

Please feel free to fork the project and provide patches back.
